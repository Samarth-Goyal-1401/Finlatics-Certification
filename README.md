# Finlatics-Certification

Completed hands-on ML projects using Python and real-world datasets, covering core algorithms and preprocessing techniques.

  Data Preprocessing & EDA
  Cleaned, encoded, and scaled data using Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn; applied handling for missing values, categorical encoding, normalization, and visualization.
  
  Facebook Marketplace Text Classification
  Built an NLP-based classification model to predict product categories from text listings using TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, and Multinomial Naive Bayes.
  Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  
  K-Means Clustering on Synthetic Data
  Applied unsupervised learning using K-Means; used elbow method to find optimal clusters and visualized cluster formation.
  Tools: Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
  
  Sales Prediction Using Random Forests
  Modeled sales forecast using Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning and error evaluation (MAE, RMSE).
  Tech: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn
  
  Simple Linear Regression
  Implemented regression to predict relationships between variables with visual diagnostics and residual analysis.
  Tech: Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
  
  Sales Prediction Project (Full Pipeline)
  End-to-end ML workflow from data cleaning to model deployment-ready pipeline; trained on multivariate datasets with model evaluation and feature importance visualization.
